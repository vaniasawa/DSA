# Matrics: Introduction

- Numbers arranged in a 2D array with dimensions M * N
- Matrix Transformations: Scaling, Translation, Rotation, Reflection
- Matrix Traversal: Simple, Spiral, and Diagonal Traversals.

Use matrices when we need to -
- Process the digital image
- Represent a graph as an adjacency matrix, where each row represents a vertex and each column is an edge
- Store results of the subproblems calculated while solving a problem using DP
- Solve mathematical equations
- Implement a grid game

Eg. 
1. Is a Toeplitz Matrix?
2. Flip and Invert an Image


## Does my Problem Match this Pattern?

Yes, if -

1. Input is 2D

No, if any one of these conditions is fulfilled -

1. Input is not given as a 2D array
2. The input data is given as a 2D array, but it falls under some other pattern and canâ€™t be solved by matrix operations. For example, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.

## Real-world problems

- Video Game
- Google's page-ranking algorithm
- Cryptography algorithms, such as Hill Cipher
