# Subsets: Introduction

- Subsets is useful in finding the permutations and combinations of elements in a data structure
- Make a series of subsets from the elements in the data structure, based on the conditions provided
- Build out the subsets incrementally (backtracking)

Eg.
1. Find all unique subsets of an array that may contain duplicate elements
2. Return all possible permutations of an array of distinct integers
3. Return all combinations of integers in an array that add up to a target number

## Does my Problem Match this Pattern?

Yes, if these conditions are fulfilled -

1. The problem requires creating permutations or combinations of the elements in the input data structure, either as the final solution or as an intermediate step.

No, if any one of these conditions is fulfilled -

1. We are not required to generate permutations or combinations of the elements in the input data structure.

## Real-world problems

- Movie Combinations
- Movie Viewing Orders
- Total cost of shopping items: An equation calculating the total cost of items needs to be divided into subsets of items.
