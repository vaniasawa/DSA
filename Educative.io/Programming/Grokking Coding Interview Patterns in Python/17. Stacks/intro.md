# Stacks: Introduction

- Linear data structure, LIFO order (like a stack of plates)
- Always return the last inserted elements
- 2 primary options - Push and Pop
- Used to store elements that are sequentially dependent on each other - elements can be popped from the stack while maintaining a fixed order

Eg. 
1. Reverse a string using a stack
2. Reverse a stack using recursion


## Does my Problem Match this Pattern?

Yes, if -

1. You want to get elements out in the reverse order in which you inserted them (LIFO)

No, if any one of these conditions is fulfilled -

1. Need FIFO processing
2. Order of the outputs or order of the processing operations is not significant

## Real-world problems

- Checking code files: Stacks are used to check parenthesis
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Recursive cell stacks: Stacks facilitate recursive subroutines
