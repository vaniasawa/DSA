# Two Pointers

Use the two pointers to iterate over an array or list, until the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

**Type of question:** Find 2 data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition (You can iterate in one or both directions)

1. Reverse a word
2. Check if the word is a palindrome
3. Find two elements in the array resulting in the target sum value.

## Does my Problem Match this Pattern?

Yes, If

1. Input data can be traversed in a linear fashion
2. Input data is sorted
3. We are considering two elements in the input data

No, If
1. Input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion
2. Problem requires expansive search of the solution space i.e. one solution does not eliminate others.

## Real World Problems

1. **Transmission Errors**: Was the same path followed from the source to the destination, and from destination to source, for the data packet?

2. **Product Suggestions**: How can you combined pairs of products together, so that your order qualifies for free shipping?
