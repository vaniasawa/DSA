# Estimate Google Play Store Revenue

Q. How much money does the Google Play Store make in a year?

- Global Revenue
- Before paying out to developers

# purchases on play store * price/purchase 

# users * # purchases/users * price/purchase [*12 for the entire year]

Gut check - 
$300B - Google
80% from revenue (ads)

4B smartphones, 75% market share - 3B play store 

# users * $spent/user [*12 for the entire year]
-----
$spent/user 

$0 - 0.7
$1 - 0.2
$5 - 0.05
$10 - 0.05

3B * $(0 + 0.2 + 0.25 + 0.5)
= 3B * $0.9
= $2.7B

Hypotheses -
- The problem statement aims to calculate the net revenue $ made by the Google Play Store in a single year.
- We will need to estimate the following -
    1. [Gut Check] Assume Alphabet's total revenue > Make assumptions about the Play Store revenue
    2. Revenue streams for Alphabet -
        - In-app purchases (one-time) [Commissions made by Google]
        - Subscriptions for apps [Commissions made by Google]

1. Alphabet's Annual, Global Revenue Stream - $300B
    - Play Store - Approximately 15%
    - Net Revenue - $45B 

2. Let's consider Revenue Streams - 
    - 80% downloads are free apps with in-app purchases (Split between users spending various amounts)
    - 20% downloads are subscription models without in-app purchases (Split between users spending various amounts)
    - Split up similar to approach above by Google PM.
