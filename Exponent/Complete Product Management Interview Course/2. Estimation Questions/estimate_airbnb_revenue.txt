# What is Airbnb's annual yearly revenue? Consider Core Service only

You could approach 

Assumptions - 
1. Global Revenue - US potentially makes up 80%, Rest 20%$
2. Are we looking at calculating the net revenue from users only, or after paying out to the hosts?
    - Let's assume after pay-out to hosts.
    - Commission rate - 10% (AirBnb keeps 20% of net user revenue)
    - AirBNB commission = 0.2 * Annual net revenue from users

Gut Check - 
1. 5B revenue
2. Assuming 80% from core services - $4B revenue

Revenue Stream - 
- Renting out accommodations to users.

American Revenue -
# households * # airbnb reservations/household * $price/reservation * 12 months

100M household, 15 vacations days per year 
- AirBNB has a 20% market share in the hospitality industry ie 20M households use AirBNB
- 20M * 15 = 300M bookings annually
Average price per night - 100$
- 30B net revenue

Commissions - 10% => 3B revenue for AirBNB

American -> Global Revenue Extrapolation:
American: 3B (80% of revenue) => Globally: $3.8B
