# Estimate Self-Driving Cars in the United States

How many self-driving cars does it take to map the entire continental U.S. in one year?
Imaging youâ€™re a Google Maps PM, working on re-mapping the continental US for Google Street View using self-driving cars. How many self-driving cars do we need to re-map the entire continental US in one year?

Hypotheses:
- The problem statement aims to calculate the # of self driving cars to map the continental US landmass in one year.
- We need to estimate -
    - The length of road that needs to be mapped by the self driving car 
    - Make assumptions about the self-driving car, including #hours of operation, avg speed, downtime
    - Estimate the distance travelled by a single car in a year, and hence determine the total cars we will need.


Assumptions:
- Continental USA land area - 3 million square miles
- Avg speed of a self-driving car - 30 mph speed limit on urban roads, 70 mph on highways - 50mph 

1. Length of road that needs to be mapped by the self driving car?
- Rural - 1 square mile - 2 miles of roads, 95% of the 3 million square miles
- Urban - 1 square mile - 6 miles of roads, 5% of the 3 million square miles

2miles of roads/1 square mile * 3 million square miles * 0.95 = 6 millions miles of road * (1 - 0.05) = 5.7 million miles of road
6 miles of roads/1 square miles * 3 million square miles * 0.05 = 18 million miles of road * 0.05 = 0.9 million miles of road 
Total miles of road = 6.6 million miles of road ~ 7 million miles of road

2. Self driving car 
- 50 mph at any given point in time
- 20 hours a day, 4 hour down time, 30 days a month, 12 months a year
- 50 mph * 20 hours * 30 days * 12
= 1000 miles * 360
= 360K miles a year
~ 400 thousand miles/year 

3. 7,000K miles of road to be covered/400K covered by one car = 17.5 cars ~ 18 cars
