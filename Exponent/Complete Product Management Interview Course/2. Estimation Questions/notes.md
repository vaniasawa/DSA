# Estimation Questions

- Making decisions based on incomplete data - gauge market size, # of users interested in a feature
- They will incorporate - Strategic understanding (TAM of a company), Technical knowledge (Cost to run Youtube for a day), Execution (Cost to capture street view images for Manhattan)

## What are interviewers listening for?

1. Make sense of the situation
2. Break down the problem
3. Make reasonable assumptions
4. Incorporate edge cases and discard unimportant factors
5. Manipulate numbers
6. Evaluate your answer in context

A great answer -
- Clear breakdown of the problem
- No needless complications
- Values are well justified
- Discuss the meaning of the final answer in context

## How to answer Estimation Questions?

### 1. Memorize Basic Facts

- 5B - Airbnb

- Median of top 20 tech giants (Disney, Intel, Adobe, Comcast, Verizon etc) - 200B

**User Populations**
- 4B - Google
- 2B - Instagram
- 1B - Facebook
- 300M - Snapchat, Amazon
- 200M - Netflix, Twitter
- 100M - Thread, ChatGPT
- 10M - Amazon number of products
- 5M - Uber drivers (~3.5 US)

**Misc**
- Weight of an average car - 4000 pounds, 2000kg
- Weight of an average car passenger tyre - 10kg, 20 pounds
- Weight of an average car engine - 500 pounds
- Weight of an average car seat - 10 pounds
- Weigth of an average airplane - 100000 pounds
- Weight of an average airplane engine - 6000 pounds
- Weight of an average airplane tyre - 250 pounds

### 2. Scope the Problem


- Clarify scope of problem with interviewer

### 3. Break Down the Problem

For example -
**Estimating the weight of a school bus**:
- Establish whether the bus is full of people or empty, full tank or empty tank
- What are the components of a school bus that you need to take into account?
    - Metal exterior
    - Weight of 1 seat * # of seats
    - Weigth of 4 tyres
    - Weight of bus engine + engine parts (coolant, diesel tank)
    - Weight of headlights, driving parts, Mirrors

**Estimating the # of miles of roads in the United States**
- Assuming we start with the total area of the continental United States -
    - Calculate road density per square mile
    - Split by rural/urban, city/suburb/rural square mile etc

### 4. Estimate
- Make some assumptions - Do not worry about the actual numbers, just be confident.

**Estimating the weight of a school bus**:
- Seats - 10 kg * 4 * 10 = 400kg
- Tyres - 320kg
    - Car Tyres - 10 kg for 5 people 
    - Bus Tyre - 80kg
- External metal - 1m^2 per person * 40 = 40m^2 Base + (1 * 10m^2) + 5m^2 = (55m^2 * 2) + (

### 5. Final Answer
- Add in the components of all your findings to get a final output.

### 4. Tell the Interviewer why you are wrong
- Your answer is most likely wrong - Give the interviewer a gut check.

## Strategies for answering estimation questions

1. Estimate via Proxy
    - Do you have another related, known number/quantity?
    - Can you extrapolate to get the number you want?
2. Personal Reference 
    - Anecdotal observation
3. Upper and Lower Bounds
    - Realistic upper and lower bound + get average
    - 

## Math Tricks 

1. Round numbers to some power of 10
2. Split your multiplications
3. Be careful when dealing with powers of 10

## Working towards a more competitive answer
1. Gut Check
2. Competitor Check

## Rubrics for Estimation Interviews
1. Problem Solving - Asking insightful questions, setting up an easy calcultion and an accurate answer
2. Comfort with Numbers - Above average ease in using numbers to an advantage, creative use of approximations, rules of thumb etc
3. Ability to Identify Possible Errors - Covered thoroughly, alternatives were offered, pros/cons neatly summarised
4. Communication - Clear and Proactive. Anticipated questions, articulated reasons for decision, checked-in throughout.
5. Collaboration - Take lead, but make use of the interviewer.
6. Creativity - Creative and out of the box thinking on display - logic maintained, novel solutions found.
